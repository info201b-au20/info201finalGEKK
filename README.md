# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

<h1>Domain of interest</h1>

As we've discussed, data science can expose underlying patterns in any domain that uses or collects data (which is nearly any domain). Anything from the forced relocation of homeless individuals (Links to an external site.) to how people gender representation (Links to an external site.) in the media, data can expose interesting (and actionable) patterns. In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -- any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in this field/domain because it is relevant especially regarding the time we live in currently. With the influx of protests resulting from George Floyd's death, we thought that it would be interesting to see the trends in police brutality over time.

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

Here are some examples of data driven projects that relate to our domain.

https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/police_and_policing/

https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

Has police brutality increased over time, especially during 2020 with all the protests against police killings recently?

Who (what groups) have been the main victims of police brutality?

Are there specific areas where police brutality is more prominent?

We strongly suggest that you complete this section first, discussing what you might want to learn, then move forward with the data discovery process.

<h1>Finding Data</h1>
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information :

- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

<h2>Source 1</h2>

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

Seattle government website : https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

The dataset says the the owner is "6506 Baden, Toby" and it was provided by the City of Seattle. I'm assuming that the data collected was generated by some type of database that the government has ahold of.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

13 rows

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

11 columns

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

This dataset shows specifically which counties that use of force happened in, and what race and gender the victim was.

“This information has been meticulously sourced from the three largest, most comprehensive and impartial crowdsourced databases on police killings in the country: FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database and KilledbyPolice.net.”
A team of 3 people collected the data.

Samuel Sinyangwe (@samswey), 30, is a data scientist and policy analyst

DeRay McKesson (@deray), 34, is the former Senior Director of Human Capital

Johnetta Elzie (@nettaaaaaaaa), 31, is a writer, protester and organizer

The Data set is about mapping police violence

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

8508 rows

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

29 columns

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

All of them :)

Has police brutality gotten worse recently after the protests?

Who (what groups) have been the main victims of police brutality?

Are there specific areas where police brutality is more prominent?

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

The Washington Post's database contains records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015. The data was collected by John Muyskens, a contributor at The Washington Post.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

5716 rows

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

16 columns

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

This dataset shows specifically the victims that were killed by police brutality and also provides armed/unarmed and the threat level.

The Principle Investigators for the Mass Mobilization project are David H. Clark (Binghamton University) and Patrick M. Regan (University of Notre Dame).This data to understand citizen movements against governments, what citizens want when they demonstrate against governments, and how governments respond to citizens. The project codes protests against governments - the data cover 162 countries between 1990 and March 2017.

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

How does police brutality actions of the United States compare or differ to other countries?
How does protestor demands of the United States compare or differ to other countries? How does the amount of protests in the United States compare or differ to other countries?
